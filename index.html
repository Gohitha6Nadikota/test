                    <p class="div7b">I came to know about the law of attraction in June and I really wanted to use it. I always wanted to study abroad. And after I finished high school I got a chance to apply for it.</p>

                <div class="row q">
                    <p class="div7b">So I applied for a scholarship and I started using The Magic and the law of attraction to get it. I used visualization, and scripting but as it was new for me, I did not have enough faith in it.</p>

                <div class="row q">

                <div class="row q">
                    <p class="div7b"> But after that, I started to look for more knowledge about the law of attraction and I started to read a lot of The Secret Success stories here as well as books related to the law of attraction(LOA).</p>

                <div class="row q">
